Through the adrenaline-mediated activation of ß2-adrenergic signaling pathways, the human body attempts to dilate narrowed airways and free them from mucus. However, the human body’s secretolytic and bronchospasmolytic capacity are limited by the internalization of ß2AR, which is induced under stimulating conditions and reduces the number of ß2AR on the cell surface.",

            "Allergic Rhinitis in Southeast Asia (Singapore): Prevalence, Burden, Management: Allergic rhinitis is a common condition in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, with a considerable symptomatic and socioeconomic burden. Allergic rhinitis sufferers report sleep disturbance, as well as a negative impairment of their quality of life and school/work productivity. Through identification of disease impact, clinicians may better understand allergic rhinitis and how to treat it.",
            "Allergic Rhinitis: Unmet Need and Current Therapies: Allergic rhinitis remains under-diagnosed, under-estimated and under-treated. Most patients treat their symptoms with over the counter medications. Multi-medication use is common in an effort to achieve faster and more complete symptom relief. Many patients remain symptomatic on current treatment, and are unsurprisingly dissatisfied with it. There is a clear unmet need for allergic rhinitis medications which provide rapid, clinically-relevant and sustained allergic rhinitis control.",
            "A New Class of Allergic Rhinitis Medication Approved by HSA: A new class of allergic rhinitis medication, comprising a corticosteroid (i.e. fluticasone propionate) and an anti-histamine (i.e. azelastine) in a single nasal spray was launched in this symposium. Results from its large clinical development programme have positioned the medication as the drug of choice for allergic rhinitis. It has a rapid onset of action (in minutes), is twice as effective as an intranasal corticosteroid, provides more complete symptom control, targets both nasal and ocular symptoms, when used both short- and long-term."
