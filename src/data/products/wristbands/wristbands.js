            "Our paper Tyvek® wristbands for events are a cost-effective solution to identify paid guests and secure admissions. They are made of authentic DuPont™ Tyvek®, which is a lightweight, high-density polyethylene fiber material. Tyvek® has been commercially used for more than 50 years and naturally lends itself to being an excellent wristband material. All our Tyvek® wristbands feature tamper-evident die-cut adhesive closure that tear when removed, enabling staff to see when patrons have attempted to share a wristband.",

            "Tyvek® wristbands are available in a variety of fun colors and patterns, such as day glow pink, navy blue, happy smiley faces, checkerboard, and more. If you can’t find the exact one you need or want to design your own, we also offer custom Tyvek wristbands for events, which can be tailored with your own patterns, logos, and text. Need wristbands for a poolside event such as a pool party at a resort? You’ll be happy to know that our Tyvek® wristbands are water-resistant.",

            "Paper Tyvek® wristbands can be ordered in both ¾ inch wide and 1 inch wide, making them well suited for children’s parties, day care centres, schools, and other types of youth organisations. Both wristbands measure 10 inches in length.",

            "Tyvek® wristbands for events are an excellent choice for clubs, festivals, and many kinds of single-day events. If you need to organise groups of patrons and staff, we have pre-designed bands that feature messaging such as “V.I.P.,” “Staff,” and “Visitor.” Select Tyvek® wristband lines also come pre-printed with serial numbering, allowing your staff to connect patrons with unique ID numbers. If you want to use wristbands to conduct a raffle, we suggest Tyvek® wristbands with pull-off tabs."

            "Plastic wristbands for events provide a high-level of security, durability, and comfort for long-term use. They are also waterproof, making them an excellent choice for water parks and resorts. If you need wristbands for ticketing, SecurMatch® plastic wristbands feature pull-off tabs so they can be used in place of tickets for food and raffles. Our plastic event wristbands are available in a wide range of solid colors and pre-printed designs. If you’re planning a Hawaiian luau for instance, consider a beach-themed plastic wristband or other fun designs. For a more personalized touch, consider custom plastic wristbands, which allow you to add your own images and messaging.",

            "Don’t need a custom design? We carry many styles of stock plastic wristbands that fit a variety of event types. For a more stylish and flashier look, consider plastic holographic wristbands, which come in glitter, confetti, and holographic patterns. They can also be customized to support your branding. Not sure whether you should use plastic or Tyvek wristbands? Plastic bracelets are better suited for multi-day events, can’t be torn off as easily, and typically need to be removed with scissors. They also hold up better against moisture and water, which makes them a good choice for poolside events and water parks.",

            "When it comes to sizing, our plastic wristbands for events are available in ½, ¾, and 1 inch widths and have notches cut out for a wide range of wrist sizes. Just wrap the band around the wrist and secure it by closing the plastic snap on a notch.",

            "Depending on the type of event and how you plan to use the wristbands, some styles may be better suited than others. To help you know which line of plastic wristbands works best for you, we’ve outlined our most popular lines below.",
